# *Neural Network Visualizer WebApp Python*
This Project Uses 2 Layered Neural Network to Identify Numbers from 0-9. It Uses a Server and Web Application as User Interface to display the Input and outputs.

## *This Repository Contains Three Different Application:-*
- **Neural Network :-** To predict the Data 
- **Machine Learning Server :-**  To Process the Data
- **StreamLit Web Application :-** Visualizing the Data/ User Interface

## *TECH STACK (Built with):-*
- python3
- Python Libraries TensorFlow, Numpy and Matplotlib
- StreamLit
- Flask

## *Data Set:-* 
- Tensorflow Built in Mnist Dataset

## *Getting Started*
***1. Prequisites Installation:***
- ***Python 3***
1. Open command Prompt/ terminal
2. Type python and press enter (if python is already installed, control will go to python command prompt go to next step)
3. If you are getting error, then download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. After downloading install the executable.
- ***Tensorflow Version(1.19.1) or above***
1. Open command prompt/terminal
2. type import tensorflow as tf and press enter (if tensorflow is already installed, you  will not get any errors)
3. If your getting error "command not found", then use the command "pip install tensorflow"

- ***Jupyter Notebook (or Any other IDE that can run .ipynb files)***
1. Download the Anaconda Installer from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. follow the [Installation procedure](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and install anaconda
3. Open Anaconda navigator
4. Open Jupyter Notebook

## *2. Execution:*

1. Open Jupyter note book
2. Upload the file.ipynb file using upload button
3. Click/double click to open the file.ipynb
4. Click run Option from menu or click "shift" + "enter" to run each cell one by one
5. Two files (mlserver.py and app.py) will be automatically created
6. Open Terminal and Execute mlserver.py using the command Python3 mlserver.py
7. Repeat the same process and execute app.py in a different terminal
8. Check for the localhost address in the terminal and open the same in browser
9. Application will be running in given Local Address
